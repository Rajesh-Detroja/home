</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;  text-justify: inter-word;">
There are currently no licensed vaccines available for COVID-19. While several antiviral drugs have been tested,
none has proved to be completely effective against the disease. In a study just published in the journal MDPI Vaccines, researchers from Bar-Ilan University have identified a set of potential immunodominant epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These epitopes are capable of generating both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses. The findings of this work may thus contribute to developing a peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections which can stop the COVID-19 outbreak and future pandemics caused by coronaviruses ... <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-06/bu-iei061020.php">Read More</a>
